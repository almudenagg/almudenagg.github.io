<div class="contentTitle"> <b> Background </b> </div>
  <br /><br /> 
      <div class="contentTextcv"><p> Understanding the dynamics of the climate system and climate change is important because of the potential negative consequences on society.  Climate models are the most valuable tools used to study the Earth’s climate. Climate models are complex mathematical tools that allow us to understand the climate system, to explore how it may change in the future and to investigate the measures we could take, as a society, to mitigate the impact of climate change. Research teams around the world work to evaluate climate models’ performance in order to improve and expand our knowledge of the climate system. The models’ representation of the interaction between the lower atmosphere and the land surface have received considerable attention by the scientific community due to its relationship with the simulation of near-surface conditions, particularly with the simulation of extreme events in summer.</p></div>

<div class="contentTextcv"><p>During my PhD program, I have been working on the evaluation of climate models’ performances, using metrics based on the representation of land-atmosphere interactions. For this porpoise, I have been working with outputs from climate model simulations participating in the 5th Phase of the  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). These climate models were used in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5) to provide a scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts. I have also designed my own modeling experiments using the  Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) to simulate the climate over North America. The design of my own set of simulations allows me to test several hypothesis arising from the analysis of the CMIP5 model simulations.  In this way, I attempt to understand the factors behind model discrepancies in simulating land-atmosphere interactions, and consequently in the simulation of near-surface conditions. </p></div>


<div class="contentTextcv"><p>While pursuing my master and PhD degrees, I have had the opportunity to gain some teaching experience by participating in several teaching assistantships and developing lab classes at StFX. Also in the last year of my PhD program, I got a part-time instructor position at StFX for teaching a course entitled "Understanding Climate Change (ESCI 272/ CLEN 202)". In addition to gain teaching experience, during my PhD program I have also being the research assistant of my supervisor, Dr. Beltrami, giving me the opportunity to familiarize myself with the university forms and formats for all kind of activities. Furthermore, over these years I have participated in several scientific review activities, serving as reviewer for the journal, JGR: Biogeosciences and taking active part in the Early careers Scientists associations group review of the First Order Draft of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis from the Working Group I (WGI) - (Spring 2019). </p></div>
